        <h2>Meet Reverbrix!</h2>
        <p>
            Reverbrix is not just another pair of headphones: it’s an innovative solution addressing real-world challenges.
            Created for individuals with auditory processing issues like Misophonia, ADHD, or hearing loss, Reverbrix uses
            selective active noise cancellation to target specific sounds that trigger discomfort or distraction, while still
            allowing important sounds through.
        </p>
        <p>
            But that’s not all: Reverbrix also features Bluetooth connectivity, so it doubles as a high-quality wireless headphone for regular listening. Whether you’re filtering out distractions or enjoying your favorite playlist, Reverbrix adapts to your needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Imagine being able to block out the clatter of a noisy cafeteria while hearing your teacher’s instructions clearly, or filtering out triggering sounds without feeling isolated. Reverbrix combines cutting-edge machine learning, selective noise cancellation, and a proprietary app to create a personalized, accessible, and stylish auditory experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reverbrix is our answer to a pressing global need, and we believe it has the potential to improve the lives of millions.

        <h2>How We Got Here</h2>
        <p>
            The idea for Reverbrix started during late-night brainstorming sessions in Aryaman’s room at NCSSM. His roommate, Om, has Misophonia, a condition that makes certain everyday sounds, like pen clicks or chewing noises, extremely distressing. Watching his roommate struggle to focus, relax, and even participate in social settings because of auditory triggers made us realize how much sound can affect someone’s daily life.
        </p>
        <p>
            To cope, Om uses hearing aid-like devices that emit static to mask triggering frequencies. While these provide some relief, they’re not ideal. The constant static can be overwhelming, and they don’t target the specific frequencies that cause discomfort. This inspired us to ask: <em>“What if we could create a device that blocks out only the sounds you don’t want, while keeping the important ones?”</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Fueled by this question, we started brainstorming, researching, and prototyping. We used NCSSM’s resources, like 3D printers and coding tools, to build a product that combines selective active noise cancellation with machine learning and Bluetooth functionality. Through iterations, we’ve refined Reverbrix to be a personalized solution for people like Om and others facing similar challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            This isn’t just a project for us: it’s deeply personal. Reverbrix is our way of helping people regain control over their environments and improve their quality of life.
