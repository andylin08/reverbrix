              <p class="slide-text">Ever since building his first cannon in third grade, Ankit has been a highly dedicated student researcher and education advocate. Aiming to help build and train the next generation of thinkers, scientists, and innovators through outreach and advocacy, he works to bring tutoring and mentorship to under-funded communities via his organization the Youth Research Initiative, which has reached 64k+ people around the world. As a youth researcher, he explores the furthest frontiers of the observable universe, from the faintest relics of local star formation to the most primordial galaxies. Coauthoring papers at some of the world’s largest universities, Ankit loves science–whether he’s independently finding elusive planets hunched over a computer at 3 AM or working with professors at various large research labs. Through his work, he has received notable accolades, including a Grand Prize at the International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF), the Davidson Fellow scholarship, and being a Broadcom MASTERS Top Award winner. Both his scientific tutelage and research work towards his central goal–to help explore the terra incognita beyond the world’s map of knowledge. Whether he’s writing chapters or pulling down books from the highest shelves for others, Ankit hopes to inspire that very same third grader building their own bottle rocket all those years ago.</p>
